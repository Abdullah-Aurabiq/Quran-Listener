"Blessed be He in whose Hand is the Kingdom, He is powerful over all things,[1]who created death and life that He might examine which of you is best in deeds, and He is the Almighty, the Forgiving,[2]who created the seven heavens, one above the other. You cannot see any inconsistency in the creation of the Merciful. Return your gaze, do you see anycrack![3]Then return your gaze once more and yet again, your gaze comes back to you dazzled, and tired.[4]We have adorned the lower heaven with lamps, and We made them a stoning for the satans, We have prepared the punishment of the Blaze for them.[5]And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there awaits the punishment of Gehenna (Hell) an evil arrival![6]When they are cast into it they shall hear it sighing, while it boils[7]nearly bursting apart out of rage. Every time a host is cast therein, its keepers will ask them: 'Did no one come to warn you'[8]'Yes, indeed' they will reply, 'but we belied the Warner (Messenger) saying: 'Allah has not sent down anything, you are but in great error'[9]And they will then say: 'If only we had listened and understood we should not now be among the inhabitants of the Blaze'[10]So it is that they confess their sins. Curse the inhabitants of the Blaze![11]But those who fear their Lord in the Unseen, for them there is forgiveness and a great wage.[12](Whether you) speak in secret or aloud, He knows the innermost of the chests.[13]Shall He who has created (all things) not know? He is the Subtle, the Aware.[14]It is He who has made the earth submissive to you. Walk about in its land and eat of His provision. To Him is the Resurrection.[15]Do you feel secure that He who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up while it shakes?[16]Do you feel secure that He who is in the heaven will not loose against you a squall of pebbles then you shall know how was My warning.[17]Those who have gone before you also belied (their Messengers) then how was My disapproval![18]Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading their wings and folding them? None, except the Merciful holds them. Surely, He sees all things.[19]Or, who is it that shall be your host to help you, other than the Merciful? Indeed, the unbelievers are only deluded.[20]Or, who is it that shall provide for you if He withholds His provision? Yet they persist in arrogance and aversion.[21]What, is he who walks, falling upon his face, more guided than he who walks upright on a Straight Path![22]Say: 'It is He who has created you and given to you hearing, sight and hearts but little is it that you thank'[23]Say: 'It was He who created you, dispersing you in the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered'[24]They ask: 'When will this promise come, if you speak truthfully'[25]Say: 'The knowledge (of that) is with Allah; I am only a clear warner'[26]Then, when they see it drawing near, the faces of the unbelievers will be blackened, and it is said: 'This is what you were promised'[27]Say: 'What do you think, if Allah destroys me and those with me, or has mercy upon us, who then will protect the unbelievers from the painful punishment'[28]Say: 'He is the Merciful. In Him we believe and in Him we put all our trust. Indeed, you shall soon know who is in clear error'[29]Say: 'What do you think. If your water should sink into the earth in the morning, who then would bring you running water'[30]"
